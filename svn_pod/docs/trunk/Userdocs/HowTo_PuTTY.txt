How To Setup Putty to SSH
11/19/2011 DEH

======= WINDOWS =====================================================

PuTTY will be used for--

- For moving the logged data in the POD onto a file of a local computer.  An alternative is to use
Hyperterm, or Teraterm, but PuTTY will server several other uses.

- SSH (Secure SHell connection) to FIT server.  SSH is uses encryption keys and is a secure
way to connect to another computer.

- Access SVN using Windows


A.  General scheme for handling/distributing field data--

1.  Get data from POD to a PC file

After the day at the field, the POD is connected to the PC and the data captured
to a file on the PC.  PuTTY is used in the serial mode to send commands and receive
data from the POD.

2.  Send PC file to FIT server

The PC file is then sent to the FIT server.  'psftp' is used to transfer
the file using the 'put' command.

3.  Others access the file on the FIT server.  

'psftp' is used to upload the file to "users" using the 'get' command.
After upload the raw data is then reformatted, expanded using a rudimentary program.
This is done after upload since the amount of data expands and one goal
is to keep the amount of file transfer time down.


B. Putty 

1. Install Putty suite: putty-0.61-installer.exe

Web site:

File:

Setup to SSH into server requires generating a pair of keys.  The
private key stays on your computer.  The public key is emailed and
placed on the FIT server.  The server then will accept SSH connections
from your computer, i.e. a computer with the private key.

2. Generate key-pair needed for login to server

a. execute 'PuTTYgen'--
   C:, Program Files, PuTTY, puttygen

Use defaults: (SSH-2 RSA), 1024 bits

b. Click 'Generate' button

Move mouse around to generate randomness.  Keep moving until the 
green progress bar finishes.

Skip entering a key passphrase unless you are worried other will use
your computer and use the key.  The idea of the passphrase is that someone
that uses your computer will not be able to unlock the private unless they
have the passphrase.  Generally, a nuisance.

c. Save PRIVATE key 

Saving the PUBLIC key DOES NOT work.  It needs to be copy and pasted into an email, or into
Notebook and saved as a file.  The "save" puts "newline" in the middle of the key.  It needs
to be one long string.

- Click private key and enter a name you wish to call it e.g. "FIT"

d. Copy *entire* public key in the window (just below "Key" "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH
authorized_keys file:" and paste into an email to 
dhaselwood@verizon.net
The public key looks like this:
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAIBmIm9JFBU+pae4WljPOmn9FiFbtdeNF3CO0d6mlFTRJKVnQU0vjPsotH8jlONUqptE88YuBIW1jjiJOldtInxaEg3M+NND8VrPedzBszByTr5sewVxGfjEzlmVHKbRPivqvPPZ7xslOr/4izvoh+J2Hv+Jfn4D18KKaABT3w== rsa-key-20111120

I receive the email with the public key and paste into the FIT in your user area.  When PuTTY, psftp, or svn 
tries to connect to the FIT server it uses this key instead of a password.

3. Connect to FIT PC using PuTTY, i.e. generally termed "ssh into the FIT."

a.  Execute PuTTY.

b.  One-time setup--

Host Name (or IP address): <user>@72.91.36.125
e.g.: georgesm@72.91.36.125

Port: change 22 to 41574

Connection type: SSH 

In left vertical window, click on Connection, SSH (expand), Auth (not expanded).  This will bring
up "Options controlling SSH authentication" window.  In the window, click "Browse"
and find the private key saved when it was generated, e.g. 'FIT.ppk'.  Don't click on the 
"Open" button.  With that in the window, click on Session (top most item on the vertical window).
Enter some identifier in the "Saved Sessions" windows, e.g. "FITSSH", then
click on Save.  This will save these settings which can be used the next time;
merely double clicking FITSSH will make the connection and autmoatic login.

Clicking on "Open" should bring up a DOS-like window with "login".  The first time this is done the
authentication protocol will warn that this is a unknown host.  Answer "yes",

The key authentication should take place automatically and you then get a prompt from the server, e.g "  At this 
point the Windows machine acts like a terminal connected a linux system, i.e. it is a secure, remote 
terminal into the FIT PC server (which is running Ubuntu Linux).

Try--
cd / [changes directory to root]
ls -l   [lists files]
cd winch/download [changes directory to /winch/download
ls -l  [lists downloaded files not transfered]
cd ../fielddata [this goes up one level, then down into 'fieldata']

To exit the SSH session--
exit


C. Setup of PuTTY to connect to POD via USB/Serial port

1.  Plug usb<->serial cable in to PC and BOX.

2.  Find COM number that Windows assigns to the usb/serial port.

Control Panel, Device Manager, Ports--should show something
like--"Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COM6)"  In this case
COM6 is what is needed in PuTTY.

3.  Start PuTTY

Click "Serial" button (default is SSH).
Enter COM port in "Serial Line" window" e.g. COM6
Enter "Speed" 115200 (9600 is default)

In vertical window on left, click "serial" (at the bottom)
Set "Flow Control" to "None" 

Go to "Session, logging" and then in "Session logging:" set 
"All session output".  Enter the file path/name--
POD&Y&M&D&T.log
This will generate a file name that has "POD" with the year,
month, day, time and .log, e.g. POD20111119221324.log.
The file name will be different each time, so there is no need
to deal with overwriting, or appending to an existing file.

Go to "Sessions" and click on "Save" to save the configuration.

In subsequent session, the configuration can be loaded by
selecting the previously saved name, e.g. "POD" and double
click to open it.

Ater openging the window show the POD.  There may not be any
data showing.  To activate the POD--
<enter>	 [Clears any previous "pause" during a readback still in effect]
x<enter> [Should show the menu]

- It may take a couple of the above.

- If the unit is in deepsleep, pressing the pushbutton
on the BOX should wake it up.  If the battery is too low the
wake up will result in an immediate reversion to deepsleep, in which
case the battery charger needs to bring the battery up above the 
cutoff voltage.

4. Capturing the POD data to the PC.

The data comes out of the POD in reverse time order, i.e. the first packet
sent is the most recent packet written.  During the readback the
"*" command pauses the readback and displays the date/time of the 
most recent record.  <enter> then resumes the readback.  When a 
time period sufficient to cover the data of interest has been read back
the readback can be terminated by 'x<enter>' command.

e<enter> [Just to be sure the readback starts with the most recent
          data]
r<enter> [The data will begin streaming by]
*<enter> [Pauses the readback and shows the current date/time]
<enter>  [Resumes readback]
