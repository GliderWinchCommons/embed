p command notes

For manual charging.

1. Monitor cells

Start a cangateBMS instance and run 'ta'

2. Set and start ELCON

Start cangateBMS instance--

ps <highest voltage limit> <current limit>
E.g. voltage 216.5v, current 1.3 amps--
ps 216.5 1.3 

Charger should start. It ramps ups.

Fans runs for currents above 1.2a.

3. Stop charging-- pj 

4. Resume charging at last voltage/current limit-- po

5. Troubleshooting

Typical line--
Col 1 - sequence number
Col 2 - ELCON TX (ELCON sends this msg)
Col 3 - DLC
Col 4-5 ELCON reports voltage (big endian, 0.1 volts)
Col 6-7 ELCON reports amps (big endian, 0.1 amps)
Col 8   ELCON reports status
Col 9-11 ELCON reserved, zeros
Col 12  ELCON payload voltages
Col 13  ELCON payload amps
Remaining columns are status--
Zero is "OK"
INPUT     = 1 means AC input off
BATT DISC = 1 means HV DC is low (~ 110v)
COMM TO   = 1 means Communications Timed out
  5 secs with no valid ELCON CAN msg received
