Notes on setting up PuTTY--

1.  Install if not already installed

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

Download and execute the installer--
"A Windows installer for everything except PuTTYtel"

2. Setting up ssh keys

Windows: Start, type in Puttygen
The search should bring it up.
Execute it.

Click: "Generate" and wiggle the mouse until it completes

Click: Save private key
Skip adding a passphrase
Give it a name, e.g. "georgefit1"

Copy the public key in the box in the puttygen window to the clipbard.

Open 'notepad'
Paste the clipboard with the public key into notepad
Save the file, e.g. 'geogrefit1.pub'
(Be sure not to add or change *anything* as an extraneous space or
newline will make it not work.  The entire key is all on one long line,
any wraparound is done locally by the displaying routine.

It should look something like the following.  Note the '== rsa-key-20140104' at \
the end.  If it doesn't have that, do it again, and again.  I don't know what is going
on, but until I got one that ended that way the FIT wouldn't accept the keys--
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAgrql5CLKvgV+UiOoWKlfw6hEqBKGIj+bD+O0iKtLVxcEEdpNuU1D67IM08cV08u4V7oMXsPuPh5NIyzVOU2j4Qchcu2aezRlu3qZ6Y/c0Y27czqG55kGkbYA+xeyeSawii/VMkAIZMy9HtB2uijBrSPD9q5fjx+4YnZaqew3cve5i4tfOqlr78NXoivgNszI7xEb3YQD1RVl0cnGqhkijkX/CmaEAGBlf2aL4tEqXI0u4Ik8nTga1a0XNU34x4G4h7LohcbyYzR+fwJC8wYuPaLoeCBQHBdR4aohAkpuH0Rw99hXydJQFQaC9jQlCQQwKp3GQycNTDVz9UKWBPQpEQ== rsa-key-20140104

email this public key file to dhaselwood@verizon.net

This file gets added to the 'authorized_keys' file in the .ssh directory of the 
individual account.

3.  Setting up PuTTY

Execute Putty

In the initial window ('sessions' on the left vertical tree)--

Host name (or IP address)
george@72.64.251.177 

Port
41574

Connection type:
SSH

Save work, so far--
In Saved Sessions
click: Default Sessions
then: "Save"

On left vertical tree:
Expand "connections:
Expand "SSH:
Click "Auth"
Under Private Key File for Authentication--
Browse
Select the file with the name of the private key save above.
Private Key File for Authentication box would look like this--
C:\Users\deh\Documents\fit6.ppk

To save work:
Click 'sessions' in left vertical tree
In Saved Sessions
click: Default Sessions
then: "Save"

4.  To make a connection

Execute Putty (if not already in it)
The settings of above should be come up since it automatically 
loads the Default Sessions file.

Click: Open

A black DOS box should open.  If successful, something similar to this--

Using username "deh".
Authenticating with public key "rsa-key-20140104"
Welcome to Ubuntu 13.10 (GNU/Linux 3.11.0-15-generic i686)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/

Last login: Sat Jan  4 20:03:38 2014 from pool-72-64-251-177.tampfl.fios.verizon.net
deh@FIT:~$

At this point you have a terminal on the FIT, so commands are being run on the FIT.


5. To run the CAN bus monitor program--

In the DOS box above, at the prompt--
cangate 127.0.0.1 32123

This should bring up the menu:

deh@FIT:~$ cangate 127.0.0.1 32123
CANGATGE has started
argc 3
Socket opened OK.  IP: 127.0.0.1 PORT: 32123
Control C to break & exit
a - load program 
d - list raw msgs
l - list time/date from time CAN sync msgs
n - list msg id's and msg ct during 1 sec
m - list msgs for id entered 'm xxxx'
p - select unit to program load from list, or enter path/name, and open .bin & .srec files
r - send high priority RESET
s - Toggle sending of test msg file to CAN bus on/off
x - cancel command
Control C to quit program

'x<enter> stops a running command and returns to the menu.

'l' command takes incoming msg ids 00200000 (current time sync msg)
and converts them to local time.

'n' command builds a table of id's it encounters and displays a count of msgs with
that id during a one second interval.  (The one second is approximate since the OS 
time resolution is not precise nor sychronized.  Even though some msgs are exactly 
64 per sec, it will sometimes display 63, then 65.)

1st col: Number of id's in the table.  Hitting 'x' and restarting 'n' restarts the
building of the table.

5th from last col: Total number of msgs during the one second interval.

4rd from last col: Total number of bytes during the one second interval.

3rd from last col: Percentage of bandwidth used

Last two cols: Error counts.

'm' command can be used to view the stream of msgs for a single id.  To start--
m xxxxxxxx  where xxxxxxxx is the 8 hex char id, in the same order/format as 
displayed in the 'n' summary line.

  The display is the msg id, payload byte ct, payload bytes

'd' command displays all msgs.

Ctl C to exit the program.

If the program is started with the path/filename of test messages on the command line
the toggling of sending ON/OFF can be done with the 's' command at anytime.  The following
is a path/filename for some test messages--

cangate 127.0.0.1 32123 /home/deh/svn_discoveryf4/PC/sensor/cangate/test/testmsg1.txt


6.  Demonstrate raw usb|uart messages via connection to a local port

After PuTTY connects--

nc localhost 32123

The raw data from the uart is displayed.

Ctl C to quit

To use telnet
telnet localhost 32123

Ctl ] gets a prompt
>telnet
Enter quit

Using 'nc' is easier.
