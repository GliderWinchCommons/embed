===================================
Setting new scale calibration "online"

Menu is command 'f'
f nn xxxxx
Where 
 nn = table position (0-63)
 xxxxx = new value

For load-cell scale--

nn = 13

China 1000 kgf load-cell (2 mv/v) approx
xxxxx = 21344

US 1000 kgf load-cell (2 mv/v) approx
xxxxx = 35268

p to save (upon shutting down for sleep)
v to flip with old value
w to not save, i.e. undo (upon shutting down for sleep)

Load-cell zero: nn = 14, but not much need for 
using 'f' command as the 'm' 'z' will automatically
re-zero (but still needs 'p' to save upon shutdown to sleep).

===================================
To compile new calibrations (ublox)

The POD gets it calibrations from the SD card.  The SD card initially
was loaded from the calibration_init_u.c, but only the first time.

To compile new values and get them used a flag has to be set that will
intialize the SD card each time.  Once completed the flag is reset and
the routine compiled again.

Edit file: p1_calibration_sd.c
At approx line 135, uncomment the following--

//cCalDefaultflag = 1;

Edit file: calibration_init_u.c

Revise values

Compile:

cd ~/GliderWinchCommons/embed/svn_pod/sw_pod/branches/pod_v2d_ublox
./mm

Flash
make flash

Or, do both
./mm && make flash

Start minicom
- Change serial port speed, e.g.
Ctla z for menu
Select serial port
Change speed
ESC, ESC, etc.

lower case 'x' return to get POD menu.
'm<enter>' to display load-cell
'p<enter>' Stores calibration_init_u.c values in SD card
's<enter?' Put in sleep
Press button wake up
New values should be present.

When satisfied--
Edit file: calibration_init_u.c
Re-comment --
//cCalDefaultflag = 1;

Compile and flash.
