./HowTo setup svn access on FIT server
11/20/2011  DEH

Current IP address 72.91.36.125

======= WINDOWS =====================================================

1.  Download and install svn-tortoise

http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html

2.  PuTTY should already be installed and working with the server

(See '../svn_pod/docs/trunk/HowTo_PuTTY.txt')  
The name of the saved settings in PuTTY will be needed.

3.  Execute Tortoise settings

Click "Network" in window on left.
Check that "SSH client:" in the windows shows a path.  If the install 
uses defaults, then it should be:
"C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin\TortoisePlink.exe"

Close window

4.  Create an empty directory where the svn will be stored.

On my Vista laptop: Computer, E:, then created "testsvn" directory.

5. Setup Tortoisesvn

Put cursor on the directory icon created in step 4. and *right* click.
A menu pops up.  Select TortoiseSVN, then move over into sub-menu.
Select "Repo-browser" and double click.  A box with "URL" pops up.  Enter--
svn+ssh://georgesm@FITSSH/svn_pod
A bigger window should pop up saying, things such as "Wait".  It takes a little
while.  If there is success, there will be a file list.  Clicking on one of them
brings up the file.

6.  Checkout a copy of the respository

Put the cursor on the directory and right click.  This time select
the checkout.  This time it will copy the latest version of the repository 
into the directory.

7. Updating the copy

After the initial "checkout" the update only updates the files that
have changed.

8.  Saving changes--"commit"

Right click on the directory and select "commit".

======= LINUX =====================================================

Step 0 Install subversion (Ubuntu)

sudo apt-get install subversion

Step 1 Setup subversion for port number and user--

cd ~/.subversion
gedit config

When gedit comes up--
Use Search/Find and enter 'tunnel' to locate
the lines--
### Section for configuring tunnel agents.
[tunnels]

Add a line so that it reads --
### Section for configuring tunnel agents.
[tunnels]
sshtunnel = ssh -p 41574 -l <user> -i /home/xxx/.ssh/id_NAME_rsa.pub
Where-- 
<user> would be the *FIT server* user name, e.g. georgesm, spencerkw, wellsca
xxx is the user name on your PC, e.g. gsm, deh,...
id_NAME_rsa.pub is the name of the public key of the generate key pair.

Note: I don't know why the '-i' option was need when I did the Toshiba laptop (Ubuntu).
It wasn't needed on the SUSE 11.2 desktop.  Maybe the /etc/ssh/sshd_coinfig
files settings between the systems are slightly different (i.e. there are a
gazillion options, some of which are not shown in the comments in the file).

Save (ctl S) and exit gedit.


Start 'sshd'
cd /etc/rc.d   [SUSE]
cd /etc/init.d [Ubuntu]
sudo ./sshd start

Step 3 Try ssh'ing to the unit--

At command prompt--
ssh 72.91.36.125 -p 41574

The first time it will give--
deh@P4-1:~> ssh 72.91.36.125 -p 41574
The authenticity of host '[72.91.36.125]:41573 ([72.91.36.125]:41573)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is e9:f8:aa:92:03:28:49:9d:15:0c:bd:82:6b:c8:88:96.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[72.91.36.125]:41573' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Last login: Sun Oct 31 12:37:22 2010 from 192.168.1.6
Have a lot of fun...
deh@Acer-150A:~> 
[At this point you have a command line into the Acer netbook.]

End ssh session with the 'exit' command.

Step 4 To checkout a svn copy

Make a directory for the svn--

cd ~ [Go to home directory]
mkdir svn_pod [directory for repository copy]
svn co svn+sshtunnelFIT://72.91.36.125/svn_pod

If it works expect something like the following (this may take a few minutes
before you see anything happending, then there can be long pauses between
what is displayed.  It doesn't end until the "revision" number comes up.)--
deh@P4-1:~/test> svn co svn+sshtunnel://192.168.1.7/DNS-321/deh/svn_stm32
Killed by signal 15.
A    svn_stm32/Usartall
A    svn_stm32/Usartall/trunk
A    svn_stm32/Usartall/trunk/Utest2.c.usart1.rxinttxint
A    svn_stm32/Usartall/trunk/Utest2.c.usart1.rxmintxdma
A    svn_stm32/Usartall/trunk/Utest2.c.usart2.rxinttxint
...
Checked out revision 6.
Killed by signal 15.
deh@P4-1:~/test> 

Note the revision number is given at the end.


Step 7 Changing IP addresses

When the server IP address changes 
cd ~/test
svn switch --relocate 72.91.36.125 192.168.1.71 
svn switch --relocate svn+sshtunnelfit://72.91.36.125/svn_pod svn+tunnelfit://10.1.1.100/svn_pod
To check if the change "took"--
svn info--

deh@P4-1:~/test100/svn_pod> svn info
Path: .
URL: svn+sshtunnelfit://10.1.1.100/svn_pod
Repository Root: svn+sshtunnelfit://10.1.1.100/svn_pod
Repository UUID: 900eff0e-d345-40af-95fc-a62b781a0c03
Revision: 404
Node Kind: directory
Schedule: normal
Last Changed Author: deh
Last Changed Rev: 404
Last Changed Date: 2011-11-09 11:27:05 -0500 (Wed, 09 Nov 2011)

This switches from the www IP address to my 
local network address, i.e.
svn switch --relocate <old ip> <new ip>
