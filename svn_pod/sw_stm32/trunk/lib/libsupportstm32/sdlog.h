10-08-2011 -- Changes to "sdlog.[ch]".

0. Changed sdlog_write(...) buffer pointer type to "void *".

1. Changed sdlog_read(...) buffer pointer type to "void *".

2. Changed the name of "sdlog_read_seek(...)" to "sdlog_seek(...)".  It doesn't
   make sense to have separate read and write seeks.  Only read seek makes 
   sense.

3. Implemented "sdlog_seek(~0ULL)" to reset "sdlog_read_backwards(...)" to 
   start reading from most recent place where "sdlog_write(...)" is at.  Also
   note that the above call returns SDLOG_OK.  Any other value of the argument 
   returns SDLOG_ERR and does nothing.

07-31-2013 -- Changes to "sdlog.[ch]".

4. Update for corrupted-block recovery.

/* The sdlog package supports logging (writing) and reading back of data packets.
 * A "packet" is a block of data of the length written.  So, you read back the 
 * same packets that you wrote.  Some general notes:
 *
 *	0.	All functions (except sdlog_tell()) return status.  If status is less
 *		than 0, then there's some sort of error.  Equal to 0 is no error.
 *		Greater than zero is no error with some sort of status.  .GT. 0 is
 *		used for returning packet sizes on read.
 *
 *	1.	sdlog_init(), sdlog_seek(...), sdlog_tell() and sdlog_shutdown()
 *		are synchronous and don't return until the operation (if any) is
 *		complete.
 *
 *	2.	sdlog_write(...), sdlog_read(...), and sdlog_read_backwards(...) are
 *		also synchronous; but due to internal buffering, almost always return
 *		immediatly.  In all cases, they return when the data has been
 *		transferred.
 *
 *	3.	The count for sdlog_write(...) must be greater than 0 and less than
 *		SDLOG_WRITE_MAX, which isn't very big (for now, 250).
 *
 *	4.	There is no reason for a read buffer used for sdlog_read(...) or
 *		sdlog_read_backwards(...) to be any bigger than SDLOG_WRITE_MAX.
 *
 *	5.	The sdlog package never looks at the data in the packet.  Packet
 *		type bytes, timestamps, etc. are all private matters of the calling
 *		client.
