1. POD versus Sensor board

Select serial port for u-blox
FTDI is on USART1
Fix #define accordingly for board.

2.  BAUD

Default ublox 38400
57600 maybe better at 5 fixes per second
 but the initial config will have to be 38400,
 then after the change recompile/reflash for the
 new baud rate.

3.  Compile and flash

../svn_pod/*32/tr*/u*
rlinkpermissions
./mm && make flash

4. Windows (maybe wine) 

Run u-center

On Virtualbox--
Enable FTDI serial port.

- Configuration view for changing parameters.
- Send after each selection change
- CFG to save after changes

Text (F8) shows u-blox msg stream.

================================
05/26/2017
Fixed up code for POD board.

"#define POD" to compile the POD code,
and comment out for the sensor board code.

Warning: The sensor board code may have been broken
by the changes.

Makefile was updated to the latest scheme that uses
the gcc launchpad compiler.

Getting serial port to work on Windows 10--
  Close u-center, if open
  Check DeviceManager to find com port, e.g. COM3
  Try PuTTY @ 38400 COM3, and open session
    should see NEMA lines
  Close PuTTY

  Open u-center.
    Receiver|port should show COM3; select
    Receiver|baud rate: select 38400
    Tiny green simulated led in lower right corner on.

  F9 to see NEMA msgs.
    Highlighted ones are the ones currently working.
    Click and select disable or enable to delete/add to
      list being sent.  Takes a few secs for the gps unit
      to respond.

  Get rid of the UBX msgs (which are binary and don't pass
    the checksum check in the POD code).

  For ublox POD--
  GGA, GRCTM, GZDA, PUBX 00
  
   GZDA not necessary, however.

Let gps unit set with power off long enough for the on-board
battery to discharge so that it doesn't start from SRAM and
see if the messages really got updated, i.e. the "save" above
did not work.


Saving the changes in u-center 8.25--
  Top level tab "Receiver"|"Action|Save
