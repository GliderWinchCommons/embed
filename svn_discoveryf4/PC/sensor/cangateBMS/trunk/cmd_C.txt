cmc_C.txt

Some static variables have default set when the program loads..
Commands can change these variables.
To restore the defaults, exit and re-execute the program.

Defaults:
Cp: CAN ID that this program sends (i.e. Poller) (A1600000)
Cw: CAN ID that this program checks for response (A0000000)
Cd: Duration between poll msgs sent (0)
Subcommand, e.g. 't' for temperature
Count of lines between printing Column header (0)

Header printing--
- The header printed depends on the motor/relay or
temperature subcommand, and matches the CAN payload
layout.

- The default (0) prints the header once upon startup. 

- A value greater than zero inserts a header every 'n'
lines.

Polling--
(See: GliderWinchCommons/embed/svn_common/trunk/db/CANID_INSERT.sql
      for CAN ID assignments)
1. Set the duration between the sending of CAN poll msgs.
	E.g. Cd 500<enter> sets 500 ms (two per second)
	When the duration is zero no poll msgs are sent.

2. Set CAN ID to send if not default
	E.g. Cp A1A00000 [EMCL2]

3. Set CAN ID for response if not default
	E.g. Cw A0200000
	Response CAN ID has to match the CAN ID in the parameter file
	in the bmsmot/emcmmc/F446/params.

4. Polling starts when the Cs command completes.
   The default duration set is 1000 ms. 

   The emcmmc software has keep-alive for the relay and motors ports
   so continuous polling is needed to maintain the settings being
   sent.
