1. POD versus Sensor board

Select serial port for u-blox
FTDI is on USART1
Fix #define accordingly for board.

2.  BAUD

Default ublox 38400
57600 maybe better at 5 fixes per second
 but the initial config will have to be 38400,
 then after the change recompile/reflash for the
 new baud rate.

3.  Compile and flash

../svn_pod/*32/tr*/u*
rlinkpermissions
./mm && make flash

4. Windows (maybe wine) 

Run u-center

On Virtualbox--
Enable FTDI serial port.

- Configuration view for changing parameters.
- Send after each selection change
- CFG to save after changes

Text (F8) shows u-blox msg stream.
