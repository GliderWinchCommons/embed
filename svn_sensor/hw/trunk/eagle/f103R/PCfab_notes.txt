1.  Pressure sensor footprint

The footprint is for the Freescale 482 package ($16).  The cheaper
($10) part has a smaller footprint.

2.  LED's 19 & 20--solder mask covers pads?

But LED 21 is not covered.  What gives?

3.  RCA jack

Right-angle jack RCJ-017, CP-1466-ND
  Holes too small.
  Missing hole for front shield

Vertical jack RCJ-024, CP-1409-ND
  Fits, but side mounting lugs have to be 
    flattened.  Hole needs to be bigger for
    side mount lugs so it can "snap" into place.

4. IC2 AP7333 3.3v regulator heat sink

The part doesn't have a heat sink under it and the
keepout area for the heat sink makes it a bit close to 
the pins for soldering.

5. JP2 - Boot0 pin goes to gnd instead of Vcc

6.  Redundant 'via' on BOOT0

7.  R9 is a little close to the via.  Move R9 up a little.

8.  Make soldermask restrict around holes for electrolytic caps so that
    SMD caps can also be used (top and bottom)

9.  Remove 3.2 regulator.
    Add ferrite bead decoupling w parallel resistor.

10. R16 on underside hits enclosure boss.

Move that and xtal up a little and xtal can go on bottom of board.

11. Input pins 1 & 11 of HC7414 should have 1 M pull down resistors.

12. EEPROM footprint is too wide--just barely makes it.

13. EEPROM SI & SO reversed!  ARGH.

14. DON'T FORGET THE CAN 3.3<->5.0V JUMPER SELECTION!

    (Leave it out and you'll wonder why CAN doesn't work.)

15. 3.5<->5.0 v jumper could have shorter pads.

16. C19 looks like 0805.  Change to 0604.

15.  PB9 mislabelled PB11 on signal.

16.  100m electrolytic caps--change hole spacing for smaller size.
493-6033-ND 22m @ 50v
P833-ND 100m @ 16v
338-1789-1-ND 220m @ 10v

17.  PB9 is mis-named PB11_ENG_PULSE

18.  R5, R7 are 0804, make them 0603.

19.  Add divider/ADC for 5v, and input voltage for measurement correction.
