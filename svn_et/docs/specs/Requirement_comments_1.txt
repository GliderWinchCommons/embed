1.  CAN

Need to mention CAN is the basis.  The text doesn't mention CAN but it 
is based on a network that is basically CAN.  Not any network would 
work, e.g. ethernet.


2. Abnormal conditions

This seems to place the burden of a sensor knowning it is reporting
incorrect data on the sensor which is seems unrealistic.  E.g. how does
the cable angle sensor know that it is reporting incorrect values?  It,
or some other monitoring program, could determine that the angle reported
is incorrect by combining the other launch data and estimating what would
be a reasonable angle.  E.g. it would not be reasonable during the ground 
run for the cable angle to be 20 degs, nor 50 degs 5 secs into the launch.  
There is some profile for the angle, given the time, distance, etc. that 
is reasonable.  It would be possible for the cable angle sensor to receive
all the launch data and do this, but that adds greatly to the complexity of
the sensor.

There is similar logic for the other sensors.  It seems like there should be
some sort of "monitor" that checks that the data are reasonable.  The most
important one is the tension sensing.  For at given torque command the tension,
after
