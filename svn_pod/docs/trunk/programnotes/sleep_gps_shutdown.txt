Problem--POD1 discharged battery completely for Uli.

Summary of shutdown logic

GPS turned on by--

Goal: Turn the GPS on 

1) 800 grams difference between the highest and lowest readings taken
over a 1/2 sec interval (i.e. 128 tension readings).  Exceeding this
threshold is taken as "activity", e.g. handling the rigging.

2) Tension over a threshold, 10000 (raised to 30000).  30 Kgf, about 66 lbs
turns the GPS on.  GPS data will be late into the launch.  If the threshold
is set too low, having the rigging in a situation where the tension exceeds
the threshold means the GPS never turns off.

GPS turned off by--

Goal--shutdown the (large) battery drain from the GPS when launching is over.

1) One hour after the last of either 1) or 2) above.  1) or 2) above reset
the one hour timeout.  If this time is set too short, then delays between launches
might cause the GPS to shutdown and not turn back on in time to get good
data for the next launch.  E.g. the glider is ready but there is a "hold" while
a plane lands/takesoff, so there is no activity as far as the load-cell is concerned.

Sleep mode caused by--

Goal--Stop everything and go into low power state.

1) 5 hours after the GPS goes off.

2) Five pushes of the pushbutton within 10 secs.

3) 's' command from the computer.

4) Either battery cell drops below 3.45 volts.

If the POD is somehow awakened and left on the shelf the GPS should timeout and 
then 5 hour timeout puts it back into sleep.  The battery drain is therefore 1 hour of
GPS and processor (but likely no load-cell load), and 5 hours of just the processor (and
likely no load-cell)

If at any time the battery drops to near end-of-charge the POD will shut down, and if
awakened the menu outputs, followed by a low battery message and back into the sleep
mode.
