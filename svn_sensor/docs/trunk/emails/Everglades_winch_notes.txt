Don,

>From my notes of 20130224.1000 made on the Labelle winch.

The tow harness -- Measurements were made before adding the load cell & pod.  We measured three parts with the canopy collapsed:

    A - 373" - Line from glider to weak link.
    B -  30" - Length of parachute canopy.
    C - 107" - Length of parachute suspension lines.

    I don't remembering measuring the weak link (between A & B, but I remember it to be about 3" long.

Tow line drum & two line

    33.75" - OD of tow line drum.
     2.25" - OD of tow line drum to OD of tow line (all line spooled up).
     4.8mm - OD of tow line.

Pressure gauge

    0.383" - OD of pressure gauge hydraulic tubing.

Front pulley

    13" - OD of front pulley
    5/8" - OD to ID of front pulley (depth of groove)
    2.25" - ID of holes in front pulley.
    0.50" - Web between holes.
    8 - Number of holes.
