Setup--

1.  Remove two jumpers on Discovery F4 board at 'cn3', i.e. move 
    to ST-LINK position.

2.  Wire cable from 6 pin header 'cn2' to 20 pin JTAG type connector.

Pin D. F4 signal JTAG pin Brd sig  
1   10K to gnd      5      JTDI   PA15
2   T JCLK          9      JCK    PA14
3   gnd             4      gnd
4   T JTMS          7      JTMS   PA13
5   T NRST         15      NRST   10K to +
6   T SWO          13      JTDO   PB3

(I don't think PA15 needs to be connected)

3.  Software details - 'Makefile'

The following for switching between Rlink and ST-LINK

OPENOCD_FLASHER	= $(OPENOCD_SCRIPTS)/interface/rlink.cfg
#OPENOCD_FLASHER	= $(OPENOCD_SCRIPTS)/interface/stlink-v2.cfg

OPENOCD_BOARD	= $(OPENOCD_SCRIPTS)/board/olimex_stm32_h103.cfg
#OPENOCD_BOARD	= $(OPENOCD_SCRIPTS)/board/olimex_stm32_h103_stlink.cfg

4.  Software details - 'openocd'

The 'board' specification needs to be modified to tell openocd that ST-LINK 
is being used.

In  /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/board/olimex_stm32_h103.cfg

Change 
  source [find target/stm32f1x.cfg]
To
  source [find target/stm32f1x_stlink.cfg]

And save as-- 
 board/olimex_stm32_h103_stlink.cfg

5.  Operation

Resetting the ST-LINK appears to only be possible by unplugging the USB 
cable to the ST-LINK of the Discovery F4.

Each time the ST-LINK is reset the permissions have to be reset.

The following script will do it--'stlinkpermissions'.  I placed it in 
/usr/local/bin--

#!/bin/sh
# Test scripts

# Find the line 'lsusb' output that has the ST-LINK
BUS="$(lsusb | awk /ST-LINK/ | sed -e 's/D.*$//' -e 's/Bus //' -e 's/ //')"
DEV="$(lsusb | awk /ST-LINK/ | sed -e 's/:.*$//' -e 's/Bus //' -e 's/[0-9][0-9][0-9]//' -e 's/Device //' -e 's/ //')"

# Give the hapless Op something gloat over
echo "/dev/bus/usb/$BUS/$DEV"

# Change the permissions
sudo chown $USER /dev/bus/usb/$BUS/$DEV
#ls -l /dev/bus/usb/$BUS
exit


The following line sets up the ST-LINK with F103.  I made this a script in ~/bin
calling it 'jtagf4x' (since 'jtag' does the F103/Rlink, and 'jtagf4' does the 
Discovery F4)--

openocd -s /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f board/olimex_stm32_h103_stlink.cfg

Open up another terminal window--

telnet localhost 4444

6.  Glitches

After successfully starting ST-LINK, then exiting, the next execution 
gives (amongst the other output)
   Error: reset device failed
Another attempt at execution gives
   Error: libusb_open() failed with LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS

Cycle the power by pulling the USB cable, execute the new USB permissions,
and it works.

Switching from ST-LINK to Rlink may require cycling the power on the F103 board.

8.  Toolchain

Most F103 Makefile have the CodeSourcery hard coded, so the .arm_tools is not used, however
to set .arm_tools, execute
~/.arm_tools_codesourcery

For the SWD, set the environmental variable, e.g.--
stlinkpermissions && export JTAG_TYPE=stlink && ./mm && make flash
