07/02/2012 - Changes for POD 2--On board GPS, (and skipping accelerometer logging)

In, svn_pod/sw_pod/trunk/pod_v1/

gpsfix.c,h

p1_common.h
Add packet type 6 for logging all non-$GPRMC sentences

p1_PC_handler.c
Allow for 'h' command and gps fix monitoring

p1_PC_monitor_gpsfix.c,h
Output line for checking on gps fix when 'h' command used.

p1_common.h
Add #define PKT_SKIP_ACCEL so that p1_logging_handler.c will
  skip writing accelerometer packets to the SD card.

p1_ad7799filter.c
Phasing of the filter so that the output flag and hence timestamp
  coincides with the 1/64th sec tick.

gps_packetize.c
Additions to provide for GPS sending more sentences.
Line length 'if' changed to see if line has a '$'
Added routines to build & buffer type 6 sentence packets

The following are not part of the 'tags' directory

svn_pod/sw_stm32/trunk/lib/libsupport/gps_time_convert.c
Search for beginning '$' rather than skip first char.

svn_pod/sw_PC/trunk/dateselect/mm

Change mm to handle x-axis so that seconds start at zero.
