Setting up USB stick from compressed image file stored on FIT server

======================================================================================================
08/31/2012

The following is a one-step version where the uncompression and writing to the desitnation is done as it downloads.

1. Get name of file on FIT to be downloaded
[Computer running Ubuntu on USB drive #1]

sshFIT
cd /usbdriveimage
ls -l

Example output of above--
...
deh@FIT:/usbdriveimage$ ls -l
total 3455380
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh deh            9 2012-08-27 13:07 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.blockcount.uncompressed
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh users 3538291501 2012-08-25 22:40 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh users         76 2012-08-26 00:27 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.md5sum.compressed
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh deh           36 2012-08-27 12:39 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.md5sum.uncompressed

<file>.gz - is the compressed image
<file>.md5sum.compressed - md5sum of the .gz file
<file>.md5sum.uncompressed - md5sum of the uncompressed file
<file>.blockcout.uncompressed - the used block count of the original stick

For convenience use the cursor and highlight the name, e.g.
ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz
and right click/copy.

==> 'exit' to exit the FIT.

2. Plug in the destination USB drive

Identify the device name--
mount

[Near the end of the listing find something like the following]
/dev/sdc1 on /media/disk type vfat (ro,nosuid,nodev,shortname=lower,flush,utf8,uid=1000)

(To make life easy) copy the file name from the screen using cursor to highlight and right click to copy--
Example: highlight from the above and right click/copy
ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz

Enter the commmand.
Example: 
usbimagecopy1step [type this, then right click/paste to get the following]
usbimagecopy1step ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz [then add /dev/sdc]
usbimagecopy1step ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz /dev/sdc

Upon "Enter" it will begin the download.  No status of the progress shows with this version
(since it uses 'ssh' instead of 'scp').

When the download is complete it fetches the blockcount and md5sum, then begins computing
a local md5sum (which will take a while since it has to read the blocks for the blockcount
downloaded.  When it is complete the two md5sums are compared.  A "SUCCESS" message is presented
if it all is OK.

3.  Testing the newly written drive.

I noticed that first boot only gives a single line that credits the author and stops.  The next
reboot then "works" (starts with the fuzzy purple screen).

The following is the first version that requires two steps (download and uncompress/write destination)

1. Get name of file on FIT to be downloaded
[Computer running Ubuntu on USB drive #1]

sshFIT
cd /usbdriveimage
ls -l

Example output of above--
...
deh@FIT:/usbdriveimage$ ls -l
total 3455380
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh deh            9 2012-08-27 13:07 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.blockcount.uncompressed
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh users 3538291501 2012-08-25 22:40 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh users         76 2012-08-26 00:27 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.md5sum.compressed
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh deh           36 2012-08-27 12:39 ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.md5sum.uncompressed

<file>.gz - is the compressed image
<file>.md5sum.compressed - md5sum of the .gz file
<file>.md5sum.uncompressed - md5sum of the uncompressed file
<file>.blockcout.uncompressed - the used block count of the original stick

For convenience use the cursor and highlight the name, e.g.
ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz
and right click/copy.

'exit' to exit the FIT.


2. Download compressed image from FIT to USB drive

[Now running with two USB drives.  One with Ubuntu, and 
one that receives the compressed image file.]

Example: Plug in orange PATRIOT drive [USB drive #2]
Check how it shows up--
cd /media
ls [Shows PATRIOT in the list]

Note: If the 2nd USB drive is plugged in before ubuntu has booted up it
might not show up as mounted (in which unplug, wait a few seconds, and
plug it back in). 


usbimagecopy <file name (.gz file)> <output path>

Example--
usbimagecopy ubuntu_12.04LTS_live_image.120825.2137.gz /media/PATRIOT

Remaing time will show in lower right-hand corner.

Check that the downloaded file is the same size as the one on the FIT.  I had
the download "stall" and after a long time it timed out with no error showing,
however the file size was smaller than the one on the FIT.  If the file size
is not the same there is no point in proceeding.  Most likley gunzip would see
something wrong with the file.

If the file sizes are the same, the md5sum should also match.  The script
downloads the md5sums for the compressed and uncompressed images.  The script
computes only the compressed md5sum.  If the two don't compare, then there is
no point to uncompressing and writing the destination USB drive, as "something"
is different.


3. Uncompress/copy downloaded file to destination USB drive

[USB drive #3 added, i.e. now running with 3 USB drives.  One with Ubuntu,
one with downloaded compressed file, and one that gets the uncompressed
image.]

usbimagewrite <file name> <source path> <destination DEVICE!>

Example
usbimagewrite ubuntu12.04LTS.120815.1620.gz /media/PATRIOT /dev/sdd

4.  Checking the md5sums

The md5sum for the original compressed and uncompressed images are on the FIT
server.  The download is the compressed file, so the comparison is made between
a md5sum made on the local file and the one from the FIT server.  When the compressed
file is uncompressed and written to the destination USB drive, a md5sum made on
the destination USB drive is compared to the original uncompressed file from the FIT.

Don't try to run the destination USB drive until the md5sum has been made since the
running of it will changes things and the md5sum will be different.

When the destination USB drive is written the md5sum from the FIT for the 
uncompressed image is displayed.  The block count is also displayed.  You have to
type in the command line with this block count to the command line that the 
script displays.
