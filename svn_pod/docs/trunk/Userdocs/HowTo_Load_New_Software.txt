HowTo_Load_New_Software

======= WINDOWS =====================================================
11/16/2011

Purpose:

Steps needed to load new software into the POD using the 
serial port and a Windows PC.

This assumes that the PC has been set up for 'PuTTY' and 'psftp'.

1. Installation of 'STM32FlashLoader' program.

a. Start 'psftp' for downloading the 'Flash_...Setup.exe'

This program can be downloaded from the FIT server.  Start 'psftp'
and at the prompt: 
psftp>open FITSSH 
Where FITSSH is the name you used to setup 'PuTTY' to access the FIT server.

The FIT server then returns a prompt after a couple of startup lines.

b. Navigate to the file on the FIT--
psftp>cd /Cortex/stm32/FLASH_LOADER_DEMO_um0462

c. Set a path where the files will go--

psftp>lpwd [Shows the current directory which 'psftp' calls "local"]
psftp>lcd C:\Users\Public [Example]

d. Download the files--

psftp>get -r FLASH_LOADER_DEMO_um0462
[This takes a while.  It copies the directory from the FIT to 
your PC at the path specified in c. above.

e. Install the loader program--

Computer, C:, Users, Public, FLASH_LOADER_DEMO_um0462,
Flash_Loader_Demonstrator_v2.2.0_Setup.exe

Follow the usual prompts for installing a program

2. Run program and load the POD

a. Start up the loader program

The program should have a folder 'STMicroelectronics' and a
subfolder, 'Flash Loader Demonstrator'.  Clicking on the
application, 'Flash Loader Demo' should bring up a window
titled "STMicroelectronics, and boxes to set up the serial
port.

If the USB/Serial port cable is plugged in, you should see the 
serial port number amongst the ones in the list.  This port
will be the same number as that found in the PuTTY setup, 
e.g. COM6.

The other boxes are OK with the defaults.

b. Put the POD in boot mode--

With the "small" box plugged in (i.e. the 4 pin RJ connector)
set the BOOT0 toggle switch to ON.  Then press the "RESET" 
pushbutton a couple times to be sure.

c. Check target is readable

Click "Next" on the PC.  The next window should show a stop light
with Green.  Flash size should show 512 KB.

Sometimes this step fails.  One error is that the POD was not reset
when the program tries to get a response.  Make sure the toggle sw is
in the ON position and press the pushbutton smartly a few times.

Another error is a red message saying the targe is write protected.
Again, go "Back," reset, and try again.

Sometimes setting the UART speed a little slower might be needed.  I've
tried it on my laptop all the way up to 256000.  Getting past this
step, however, might be more reliable at a slower speed.  At 9600 baud the
program load takes about 45 secs.  Since there is a readback-verify once the
program is loaded going as fast as possible doesn't hurt the reliability.

If the green on the stop light is on, click Next.

d. "select device from target list"

No changes should be needed on this window.

"Target" should show STM32_High-density_512K"

The window below should be filled with "Page" lines.

Sometimes it takes a few seconds before it fills in the data.

If it is filled with data, click Next

e. Setup file to be loaded

Click "Download to device"
Click "Globabl Erase"
Select file by click on button just above and to the right
of "Global Erase".  This gives brings up a "browse" window
to find the file.

The file to loaded has an extension of "hex," e.g. 'pod_v1.hex'.
Double click to open it, which brings you back to setup window.

f.  Load the flash in the POD

Click on "Next"
A progress bar shows the loading, follwed by a readback and verify.
It should end with the bar green and "Download operation finished
successfully."

g.  Start POD

Turn toggle switch on "small box" back to OFF.  Press RESET

Close FLash_Loader... program on PC.

Launch 'PuTTY'
Click on "POD" in the "Saved Sessions" window, then click on
Load.
Click "Open"
Press Pushbutton on BOX (large box).  This is needed because when the
'pod_v1' routine comes out of RESET flashing a new program it appears 
to the startup program to have been in a deepsleep state, so it updates
the time and goes back into deepsleep.  Pressing the Pushbutton on the 
(large) BOX wakes it up (which is different than pressing RESET on the
small box).

Typing in a command, e.g. 'm' to see the load-cell should show that the
POD is running.






If nothing is showing, type "a<ret> to see current accelerometer data,
or "b<ret> to see battery/temperature data.  'x<ret> goes back to the
menu, etc.
