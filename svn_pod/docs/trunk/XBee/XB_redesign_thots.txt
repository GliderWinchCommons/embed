Items for mods for XBee/telemetry pod--

1.	Single LiPo cell

4.15->3.5v voltage stays within voltage regulator dropout for 3.3v.

Still requires auto sleep to prevent overdischarge.  However, just one
cell to measure & resistor divider switch off.

2.	RS-232 level conversion external (if it saves board space).

An off-board RS-232 converter needed.  The battery charger will most likely
have to be homemade, i.e. the chargers are for 2 or more cells.  Hence,
the low battery shutdown, charge contoller, and RS-232 would go on a board
external to the pod.


3.	On/off switch

XBee xmit will be rather heavy battery drain.  

- On/Off switch turns unit ON or OFF.  When ON, the AD779 and load-cell bridge
are powered.  3.3v on the load-cell instead of 5.0v drops the current a little.

When the load-cell reading is greater than "x" (maybe 10 kg) trigger the xmit (and allow for "y"
secs below this reading before shutting off).

- Alternate scheme: On/Off switch turns unit ON or OFF.  Pressing the pushbutton turns on the transmit
"x" secs (maybe augmented by xmit time is extended 30 secs if tension goes above some threshold).

4. 	No xtals

Use internal osc.  Saves board space, etc.

5.	3.3v Bridge excitation

Allows one cell battery, cuts power.

6.	SWD v JTAG

Cut real-estate either by different connector
or SWD, or both, or ...

7.	4 pin RJ-11 connection

+ charging, ground, USART TX, USART RX.

Monitoring the load-cell might be needed for checking load-cell calibration, and that the unit
is working.

8.	No jacks for software reload

Software reload requires opening it up to get at SWD/JTAG

9.	Beeper?

An on-board beeper might be useful.  It would beep when the On/Off switch is On and
the XBee is xmitting.  An LED means it has to be visible, and if the board is in some
protecting case then the LED has to be external, and the means wires and LED mounting,
etc.  Not desirable.
