Notes--

1.  Checkout a copy of svn_ultrasonic

If the Ubuntu USB drive does not have a copy, then one out.

cd ~ 
svn co svn+sshtunnelFIT://$FITIP/svn_ultrasonic

This will create a directory
~/svn_ultrasonic
with the latest revision.

2. svn_pod must also be present.

svn_pod must be at ~/svn_pod, since some of the stm32 
libraries are used by svn_ultrasonic routines.

3. Saving changes

cd ~/svn_ultrsonic
svn commit -m 'some comment'

4. Adding files & directories

A new file doesn't automatically go into the svn.  It
must be added.  That way you can have many files that
are not intended for the svn to be the same directory, 
e.g. it is not customary to put compiled files in the
the svn such as .map, .list, .srec, etc., since that
can be generated from the source code.

To add a file
svn add <file name>

Wild card name permitted, e.g. *.c

To add an existing directory
svn add <directory name>
This will add *all* the files in the directory and 
directories below.

To create a directory directly
svn mkdir <directory name>

5. Deleting files

svn rm <name>

6.  Tips

Adding/deleting does not change the svn on the server until a "commit".

Once a "commit" is done it is forever there.  One can go back and reload
earlier revisions.  The svn saves *changes*.

Adding, then deleting before a commit is done gives an error.  Suppose you
did svn add and then wanted to remove the file before doing the commit--
svn rm <file name> --force
The commit will show and "A" followed by a "D" (delete).

"commit" only does the commit for the directory you are in.  To be sure that
the changes in all the other directories are committed, 
cd ~/svn_ultrsonic
svn commit -m '<comment>'

7. Update before starting a session

Someone may have done a commit so do "svn update" before starting.
cd ~/svn_ultrasonic
svn update
