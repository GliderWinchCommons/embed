These two convert routines are for assistance in making a vector.c, and nivc_f3.h files
for the F3.  The source is taken from the ST library for nvic.h and modifying the fields
to the libopenstm32 format.  

The output is piped to a file, e.g. "x", and that file used with the editor to makeup
the final file.
