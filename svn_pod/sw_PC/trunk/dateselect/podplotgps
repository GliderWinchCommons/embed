# podplotgps - use gnuplot to plot a reformatted/sorted/merged POD data file
# 09-18-2012 Cloned & hacked form podplot for handling gps data
#
# To execute this script--
# podplot <filename>  [The file name ends in 'RM (for Reformatted Merged)]

# Count the number of lines and set GNUDUR
GNUDUR=$(awk '{ ++x } END { print x }' $1)

# Each line is 1/64th of a second
GNUSEC=$(echo $(( $GNUDUR / 64 )) )

# Export to environment so that 'gnuplot' can access these variables
#      filename
export GNUFILE=$1
#      Number of input lines
export GNUDUR
#      Number of seconds (truncated, of course)
export GNUSEC

# The following for debugging
echo GNUFILE is set to $GNUFILE
echo Number of input lines: $GNUDUR
echo Number of seconds: $GNUSEC

# Execute 'gnuplot' and graph tension & accelerometer, then save image as a .png file
gnuplot "plotGNUFILEgpsP.gp"
