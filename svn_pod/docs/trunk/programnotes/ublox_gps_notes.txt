Notes about the ublox version of POD--


Currently in the directory of the github repository--
~/GliderWinchCommons/embed/svn_pod/sw_pod/branches/pod_v2b_ublox


1.  On board LED flashing

Of the two pairs of on-board SMD LEDs--

Red 
  single
     Program running
     Good "sentences" lines from the GPS module
     But, GPS is not ready ('cGPS_ready' flag)
       which means logging has not started

  double
     Above, but GPS ready ('cGPS_ready' flag)
     The ready flag is set when there has been 
     four consecutive good time ticks
     (counted by 'uiConsecutiveGoodGPSctr')

Green
  Good GPS fixes


2.  LED on GPS module

Steady OFF = not powered
  'j' command manually turns power off

Steady ON = powered
  'i' command manually turns power on
  Pushing pushbutton turns power on.

Flashing = once per second ticks
  GPS as locked onto satellites and is producing
  good fixes.
