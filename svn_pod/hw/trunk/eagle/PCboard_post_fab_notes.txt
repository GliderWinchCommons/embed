VET6_POD pc board notes:

1.  RJ-45 upside down [again!]

If the RJ-45 pins jack is mounted on the board (i.e. it has to be on the
underside of the board), the numbering is then backwards.  Looking into the
RJ-45 jack with it right side up, pin #1 is the leftmost pin.

When the RJ-45 is mounted on the bottom of the board, the pin numbering
below matches the connector and schematic.

Pin  Color       Signal net name               DB9
1  - grn/wht     T1OUT_USART1_TX                2  grn
2  - grn         RS232_R1IN_USART1_RX           3  red
3  - org/wht     PA1|RJ-45_SPARE
4  - blu         GND                            5  blk
5  - blu/wht     RJ-45|RS232_R2IN_UART4_RX
6  - org         PA0_WKUP|RJ-45
7  - brn         TOP_CELL_RAW
8  - brn/wht     PB1_ADC8|BOTTOM_CELL

About 15 in of CAT5 cable (stranded) is used from the RJ-45 pads to the
jack.  The connections to the remote jack are made the same as if the 
jack were mounted directly on the board (so that the cable plugging into
the remote jack will also work on the board-mounted jack.

The CAT5 wires are small enough to go through the strain-relief holes/pads 
beside the RJ-45 connector pads.  (Note: the strain relief vias are connected
to GND, so I drilled them out JIC the sharp corners might cut through the 
insulation of the wires.)

For the right-angle jack.  For the vertical, the
pin spacing and mounting holes are wider.

2.  Pin #1 on IC dots not showing up on board silk screen.

3.  MCP1702 doesn't have a heatsink pad so tstop not needed on board.

4. LED's

a.  "LED" legend for 4 leds whacked off by tstop edging.
b.  Polarity line would be useful.
c.  Furture designs--tri-color single unit(?)--

5. AD7799_1 aliasing filter details--

Board #1
  |  R31,33 R26,28 R22,24  C21   C20   C19
  1    100    330    330  12.2  22.0  22.0 
  2    100    330    330  12.2  22.0  22.0 
  3    100
  4    100
  5    100
  6    100    330    330  10.0   4.7   4.7

12-5-2011 values changed
C21 = 4.7+2.2 uf
C19,C20 = 4.7 uf
R31,R33 = 0 ohm
R22, R26 = 330/2 
Target- 9 db down at 50 Hz

6. R113 substitute (only had 100 ohm 0603)

Board #
  |  R113
  1    39 0805
  2    39 0805
  3    39 0805
  4    39 0805
  5    39 0805

7. Strain guage YEL & WHT numbers are backwards

YEL2 and WHT2 on the silk screen should be YEL1 and WHT1, etc.

8. 5v strain gauge regulator needs bigger cap

47 uf added.  100 uf did better

9. 3.2v ADC regulator needs bigger cap

Same as 8. above.

10. C12, C14 and C110--Needs to be bigger

C14|C110--Adding 4.7 uf across the existing 0.1 uf gave a noticeable improvement of the
AD7799 noise.

C12--However, the AD7799 3.3v switch can cause the 3.3v regulator (IC4, MCP1702) voltage
to drop enough to cause a low voltage reset of the processor.  Increasing C12 to 47 uf
tantalum solved the problem.  Another solution might be to slow the FET switching via
an RC on the gate, and/or setting the pin current drive to the lowest setting.

The best/simplest solution appears to be a separate regulator for the AD7799 3.3v digital side (as
well as the 5v analog, of course).

11. Accelerometer

Sparkfun triple axis accelerometer, P/N SEN-09269 pins are somewhat different than the PC
board layout.  Offset the accel board by one pin, use a jumper used for the V+.  The pin
alignment is below--

Left to right (across bottom)
Board Accel
  V+   jumper
  Gnd  ST
  X    Z   ADC12-IN10
  Y    Y   ADC12-IN11
  Z    X   ADC12-IN12
  Gnd  Gnd
	Vcc
		
  Note: that for the software, the X,Y,Z order is also reversed from that shown on the Sparkfun
board.

  Note: X - ADC12-IN10 is labled incorrectly on the eagle .sch,.brd files as ADC12-IN11, when it
should be ADC12-IN10...

12. Open load-cell circuit protection

Piggyback 470K resistors across C18 C19 (C121, C123) so that inputs to the ADC don't float if the
load-cell is not connected.  This may cause a lockup of the AD7799.
