gpiotest

The old gpiotest with additions & macros for USART2* and XBee
pins.

xbsetup

Initially in a loop to send AT commands and display responses.
'x' as first char breaks loop and a second loop then sends
lines typed in and displays responses.  'x' breaks this loop
and the port letter/pin number on/off as above in gpiotest.


xbloopbk_w

General scheme:

Sends to the pod end and listens for a repsponse.  The expected
response is the string sent plus an appended RSSI of that the pod
end measured.

USART1 outputs the outgoing message and the incoming message and
adds the RSSI this end measured.

Companion to ~/svn_pod/sw_XB_pod/trunk/xbloopbk_p.

xboneway_w  03-24-2012

Receives from pod end.  Uses API mode with XBee


xbrange_w 04-09-2012

Sends a packet to the pod end, then listens for a reply.  If there is a
reply it displays the count and the RSSI of that the pod end sent as well
as the RSSI of the packet just received from the pod end.  If the timeout
occurs it displays '*' and local count.  A hack of xboneway_w.
