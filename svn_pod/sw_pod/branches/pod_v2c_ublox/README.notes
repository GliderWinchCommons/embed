This a version for POD #2 and POD #2b--5 Hz GPS and 32 KHz osc not used.
rev 668 (appears) to work with 1 Hz GPS on BOX 1, and BOX 3.  Following rev 668
changes are being made to shift it over to the 5 Hz GPS.

Changed back to work with 5 Hz gps.
- $GPRMC sentence slightly different with POD 1, i.e. "A" at end of fields is not
present on POD 2 gps, probably due to differences in NEMA setup.

#ifdef GPS_SWITCH_PRESENT added to gps_packetize.c to make it easy to ignore the power
up/down switch for enabling the GPS 5c regulator power.

Commented out packet type "2" in gps_packetize.c, since it would give a packet with
zero extended linux time after the unit came up out of sleep mode.

Fixed search so that it won't stop on a zero time packet.

Added epoxy to tacked on resistor divider for GPS time sync pulse.

Seems to work, but auto-shutdown needs some investigation, as well as five pushbutton
pushes shutdown.

Rev 671 at this point.
