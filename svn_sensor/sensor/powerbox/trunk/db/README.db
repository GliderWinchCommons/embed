The stm32F405/7 has bigger sectors than
the stm32F103.  

For high flash the F4 has 128K sectors and the
F103 2K sectors.

Rather than storing a table in each sector, since
the F4 sectors are large, they are compiled and stored
at the same offsets from the top of flash as the F103.

Updating the tables is not completely independent since
all the tables have to be read into the sram even though
only one table might be updated.
