HowTo_retrieveFITdata.txt

03-22-2012

Objective: Retrieve POD data from the FIT into a file on the USB drive
that can be accessed by another OS.

1.  Determine file name on the FIT to retrieve--

sshFIT	[connect to FIT]
cd /winch/download [navigate to download directory]
ls -l [list files in directory]
exit [Be sure you are not still connected when you do
the rest of the steps.]

[Note file name to be retrieved.  The easiest way is
to position the cursor and hold down the left mouse
button and drag the cursor across the file name, excluding
the ".gz".  In the following example the above steps and the
responses are shown below--]

deh@P4-1:~> sshFIT
Linux FIT 2.6.35-32-generic #65-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 24 13:48:14 UTC 2012 i686 GNU/Linux
Ubuntu 10.10

cd /deh@FIT:~$ cd /winch/download
deh@FIT:/winch/download$ ls -l
total 468
-rw-r--r-- 1 deh    deh     66671 2012-03-13 22:28 120225.131700.gz
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  40639 2012-03-13 22:14 120314.014453.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root   368300 2012-03-13 22:29 toss.gz
deh@FIT:/winch/download$ 

[File: 120314.014453.gz is POD data that starts on March 14, 2012 at 
hour:minute:second 01:44:53.  'gz is the type of compression.]

2.  Retrieve the file from the FIT

Execute the script with the file name (without the '.gz') to be retrieved--

retrieveFIT 120314.014453

If it is successful it will end with a graph of the data.  
To exit the graph put the cursor on the terminal window, click, hit
enter,...the graphing script has an indefinite pause so it waits so a
<enter> kills the graph.

The file retrieved is un-compressed into three files (raw, sorted/merged, graph pdf) and 
stored in /cdrom/winch/download under Ubuntu, but F:\winch\download (if the USB drive 
happens to be drive F in Windows).  

On my Vista laptop Windows shows the USB drive as "F: Install Ubuntu".  The "install" doesn't
mean it will install it.
