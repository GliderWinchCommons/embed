Subject: POD graphs and data: 120519_3rd launch

Attached is the converted data file and graphs for the May 19, 2012, 3rd
launch.

At the end of this launch something happened with the load-cell.  My
current guess is that there was a momentary open circuit that caused the
ADC to lockup.  From the graphs it appears to have taken place during
the ground handling after the release, and it looks like after the chute
was on the ground.

The load-cell fault causes the tension data for the full time period
compressed, so I stripped off some of the trailing data as well as
little of the data at the beginning during the period when there was no
tension or accelerometer data that indicated activity.

The file attached--

'120519.182300RM' covers the full data downloaded.
'120519.182300RM.pdf' is the graph of the full data download
'1120519.182300ARM.pdf' is the graph of the stripped down file

The format of the 'RM file is--
Column 1 - linux time (good for computer sorting, not good for humans)
Column 2 - tension (grams)
Column 3 - Z axis (g)
Column 4 - X axis (g)
Column 5 - Y axis (g)
Column 6 - square root of sum of squares of X, Y, Z (g)
Column 7 - 13 Readable date/time (gmt)
Column 8 - 1/64th tick with in one second


- Each line is 1/64th of a second

- The accelerometer data logs at 1/8 the rate of the tension so there
are 8 identical accelerometer readings in a row.

- The accelerometer readings that are all 1 at the beginning is merely
padding until the first accelerometer packet in the readout is
encountered.

Depending on what you open the pdf with the program might allow
stretching the plot horizontally (and vertically if desired) and get a
better look at the detail.  

I send separate emails with the 1st and 2nd launches.
